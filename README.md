The player can move left, right, up and down using the keyboard's arrow keys. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene.

Once a the player collides with an enemy, the player loses a life and is put back in the starting location. Once the player reaches the water, the score is increased by 1 point as represented in the top right.
